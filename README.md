# docker-ai-tools

Since the `nx` injection attack in Aug 2025, I'm quite weary of running
`gemini` or `claude` on my machine without wrapping it into a container of
some kind.

## build / development habbit changes

When using these tools, it'll be in an isolated sandbox environment without
access to the main terminal/host OS.

### linux flavour

Debian is the safe bet here as opposed to alpine linux which may encounter its
own issues (g++, make, python3 issuess)

## claude-code


## gemini-code


## push to docker hub

using `tedk42` user.
